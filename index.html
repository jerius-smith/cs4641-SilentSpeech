        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Silent Speech Detection aims to detect language when no sound is transmitted. This technology can be implemented in many use cases, such as
            private communication between soldiers on a battle field, or interacting with conversational AI, like Siri or Alexa, in noisy environments.
            Research has gone into using many different mechanisms to capture data from the mouth. Some have used surface electromyography and
            video. But we would like to use SmartPalate, a retainer-like device which can be used to track the position of of tongue. Unlike
            other devices, SmartPalate is partially invisible and can be used when walking. Our goals is to link sensor information to letters.
            Our work expands upon prior work that focused on word utterances. By focusing on utterances at the letter level, users will have increased
            flexibility compared to a 15-word vocabulary which was used in previous work.</p>

        <h2>System Overview</h2>
        <p>The SmartPalate device consists of 124 capacitive sensors and each sensor reads as a 1 or a 0 at every time step. There are orginally
        100 time steps for each sample but we reduced each sample down to just 15. </p>
