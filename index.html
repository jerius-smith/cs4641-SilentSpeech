    <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>We created a silent spelling system that aims to recognize language from silent utterances. This system is useful for people with speech impairments, for people in noisy environments, and for people in social situations that restrict speech. Speech impairments may result from ALS, tracheostomies, or deafness. Noisy environments limit the effectivess of conversational AI. Social situations, like lectures or meetings, may require a subtler interface than speech. Additionally, silent speech systems provide more privacy for sharing information than speech.
            Researchers have explored using different sensors, like surface electromyography and
            video, to capture data that encodes speech. We further existing research on speech recognition by using Hidden Markov Models to recognize silent utterances at the letter level, and increase the accuracy of our recognizer by introducing a context training and a statistical grammar.
            Unlike other devices, SmartPalate is partially invisible and can be used when walking. Our goals is to link sensor information to letters.

        <h2>Experimental Design</h2>
        <p>The SmartPalate is a retainer fitted with 124 capacitive sensors. Each sensor records a zero or one at a frequency of 100Hz.
            The SmartPalate was used by an individual to collect two datasets. The first dataset consisted of 20 samples of each letter 
            of the alphabet. The second dataset consisted of 10 samples of 10 phrases from the Mackenzie phrase set, that were constructed 
            from the best recognized letters from the first dataset. The algorithm used to classify the first dataset was a Hidden Markov 
            Model. The algorithm used to classify the second dataset was a Hidden Markov Model with context training and a statistical 
            grammar.
